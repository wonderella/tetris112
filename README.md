# tetris112

# From the basis CS Academy gave us, here are some of the
# other things that I added myself.

# 1. I made it a little prettier... it's now on a black background
# and I changed some fonts and colors 

# 2. There's an animation for game over! It fills the board from bottom 
# to top with white. I felt like that was something I've seen on tetris games

# 3. There are levels! Every 10 lines cleared moves to the next level where 
# the speed increases by half a step per second...one step felt too fast
# but maybe I'm also bad.
# Also it tells you "Level Up!" keeps track of the levels and lines cleared 
# on the side

# 4. When you hover over the restart game button it highlights...very small
# but I thought it was cool

# 5. There's an icon to show the next tetris block that's coming up on the side.

# 6. When researching point structures I found out it's called "Tetris!" when you
# clear four lines at once. So when you get a "Tetris" it tells you

# 7. When you get points, the score is highlighted for a couple seconds

# 8. There's a small highscore board on the game over screen that keeps track
# of the last top 5 scores
